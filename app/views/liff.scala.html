    <p><b>CANNOCK CHASE</b> (n.)</p>

    <p>In any box of After Eight Mints, there is always a large
    number of empty envelopes and no more that four or five
    actual mints. The cannock chase is the process by which, no

    most of the empty sachets before pinning down an actual
    minot, or 'cannock'. The cannock chase also occurs with
    people who put their dead matches back in the matchbox, and
    then embarrass themselves at parties trying to light

    <p>A 'clabby' conversation is one stuck up by a
    commissionare or cleaning lady in order to avoid any
    further actual work. The opening gambit is usually designed
    to provoke the maximum confusion, and therefore the longest
    possible clabby conversation. It is vitally important to
    learn the correct, or 'clixby' (q.v.), responses to a
    clabby gambit, and not to get trapped by a 'ditherington'
    (q.v.). For instance, if confronted with a clabby gambit
    such as 'Oh, mr Smith, I didn't know you'd had your leg
    off', the ditherington response is 'I haven't....' whereas

    <p><b>CORFE</b> (n.)</p>

    <p>An object which is almost totally indistinguishable from
    a newspaper, the one crucial difference being that it
    belongs to somebody else and is unaccountably much more
    interesting that your own - which may otherwise appear to
    be in all respects identical. Though it is a rule of life
    that a train or other public place may contain any number
    of corfes but only one newspaper, it is quite possible to
    transform your own perfectly ordinary newspaper into a
    corfe by the simple expedient of letting somebody else read
    it.</p>

    <p><b>CORFU</b> (n.)</p>

    <p>The dullest person you met during the course of your
    holiday. Also the only one who failed to understand that
    the exchanging of addresses at the end of a holiday is
    merely a social ritual and is absolutely not an invitation
    to phone you up and turn up unannounced on your doorstep
    three months later.</p>

    <p><b>CORRIEARKLET</b> (n.)</p>

    <p>The moment at which two people approaching from opposite
    ends of a long passageway, recognise each other and

    ghastly embarrassment of having to continue recognising
    each other the whole length of the corridor.</p>

    <p><b>CORRIECRAVIE</b> (n.)</p>

    <p>To avert the horrors of corrievorrie (q.v.) corriecravie
    is usually employed. This is the cowardly but highly
    skilled process by which both protagonists continue to
    approach while keeping up the pretence that they haven't
    noticed each other - by staring furiously at their feet,
    grimacing into a notebook, or studying the walls closely as
    if in a mood of deep irritation.</p>

    <p><b>CORRIEDOO</b> (n.)</p>

    <p>The crucial moment of false recognition in a long
    passageway encouter. Though both people are perfectly well
    aware that the other is approaching, they must eventually
    pretend sudden recognition. They now look up with a glassy
    smile, as if having spotted each other for the first time,
    (and are particulary delighted to have done so) shouting
    out 'Haaaaaallllloooo!' as if to say 'Good grief!! You!!
    Here!! Of all people! Will I never. Coo. Stap me vitals,
    etc.'</p>

    <p><b>CORRIEMOILLIE</b> (n.)</p>

    <p>The dreadful sinking sensation in a long passageway
    encounter when both protagonists immediately realise they
    have plumped for the corriedoo (q.v.) mutch too early as
    they are still a good thirty yards apart. They were
    embarrased by the pretence of corriecravie (q.v.) and
    decided to make use of the corriedoo because they felt
    silly. This was a mistake as corrievorrie (q.v.) will make
    them seem far sillier.</p>

    <p><b>CORRIEVORRIE</b> (n.)</p>

    <p>Corridor etiquette demands that once a corriedoo (q.v.)
    has been declared, corrievorrie must be employed. Both
    protagonists must now embellish their approach with an
    embarrassing combination of waving, grinning, making idiot
    faces, doing pirate impressions, and waggling the head from
    side to side while holding the other person's eyes as the
    smile drips off their face, until with great relief, they
    pass each other.</p>
